# Konekti

## What is Konekti?

Konekti (the Esperanto word for "plugin" or "to connect") is a monorepo that consolidates plugins from other tools and extensions. Konekti is the icing on the cake for libraries, or perhaps not; the reason for the existence of this documentation is that, in a few weeks or months, I will probably forget everything (**Basically, this is to understand what the hell I'm doing**). I don't know if what you will see here will help you, but I hope it does. Good luck!

Konekti is designed to be used in different types of projects, but some plugins and extensions are for specific platforms or tools, and some plugins are specifically designed for my personal use.

## Why should you use Konekti?

**I'm not quite sure why, but I don't want to discourage you. Feel free to explore various Konekti plugins and extensions that pique your interest, and if you find them truly appealing... well, why not give it a shot?**

## How do these docs work?

This documentation is divided into several sections that represent the packages. Each section is about a single package, and the purpose of this is to provide independent and easy access to the packages you want to explore. Refer to the [Packages](/packages/) section to see the list of packages.
